Some of these plugins are modified versions of others plug-ins. I've done this if the original author is not currently active or if many requests for changes are made and the author hasn't responded.

*IN NO WAY* do I take credit for their work. I simply take credit for my changes, and release them for users to enjoy.

I strive for my plug-ins to meet three requirements:

* Reliable
* Ease of use
* Useful information easily reachable.

A couple features to note:
* Message letting you know at a glance whether your data and configuration files will remain after a reboot
* Easy to use updater for applications that have spotty updaters or no in-app updater at all, plus update notification
* I am always around to answer questions, setup related and if possible, application related

Although unRAID is considered by some to be a "enthusiast" OS, and that many users will be use to computers, command line, and linux, I want my plug-ins to be as simple as possible so that the average joe can use the plug-ins and not have to guess if what they are doing is right.

I hope you enjoy my releases, and as always, if there are any suggestions, feel free to let me know.

If you like my work, feel free to donate. I will NEVER require a donation or payment.
